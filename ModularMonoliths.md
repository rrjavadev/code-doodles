# **Monoliths, Microservices, and the Modular Middle Ground**

For the past 9-10 years, my experience has been solely with microservices, a once highly fashionable architecture that made monoliths seem like a shameful legacy. 

For a while, microservices were the **gold standard**‚Äîthe trendy, modern approach. Talking about monoliths felt almost taboo. Monoliths were seen as **"legacy,"** and let's be honest, **legacy** often carries a negative connotation.  

## **The Microservices Promise vs. Reality**

Monoliths were criticised for:  
- **Spaghetti code**  
- **Unclear domain boundaries**  
- **Scaling challenges**  
- **Slow delivery cycles**  

Microservices, on the other hand, promised:  
- **Agility**  
- **Faster scaling**  
- **Independent deployability**  
- **Technology flexibility**  
- **Greater team autonomy**

And while I wouldn‚Äôt completely disagree with those claims, what many teams didn‚Äôt immediately realise was the **hidden complexity of distributed systems**.  

Maintaining **dozens (if not hundreds) of microservices** became **operationally expensive**, and developers had to master containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines, security, and networking ‚Äì complexities previously abstracted away. 

### **Challenges with Microservices**  

Over time, teams started recognising that **microservices weren‚Äôt as easy as they seemed**. Challenges emerged, such as:  
- **Operational complexity**  
- **Chattiness between services**  
- **Difficulties in integration testing**  
- **Complex resiliency constraints**  
- **Breaking API changes**  
- **Cascading failures**  
- **Costly deployments**

## **The Rise of the Modular Monolith**  

Monoliths are making a **comeback**, but under a new name: **Modular Monoliths**.  

Given my past experiences navigating different architectural patterns, I approached this concept with **skepticism**.  
My main question was:  
**What exact problem is the modular monolith solving?**  

### **Key Improvements in Modular Monoliths**
In modular monoliths, there is a greater emphasis on **clearly defining module boundaries**.  
This is a step in the right direction because **unclear boundaries** led to:
- **Microservice chattiness**  
- **Spaghetti code in monoliths**  

### **What About the Database?**
If we modularise only the **source code** while keeping a **tighly coupled database**, we‚Äôll run into the same issues monoliths faced in the past.  
Instead, **introducing cohesion at the database level** can significantly improve modularity. Decouple the tables based on their domain boundaries. While they reside in the same physical database like a typical monolith, the tables are logically separated and therefore this limits inter-module database access.

### **Vertical Slice Architecture**

The essence of a modular monolith lies in vertically slicing the application layers. Instead of dividing the application into horizontal layers, create distinct vertical splits for the UI, backend code, and database.

The diagram emphasises the clear separation between the modules. Ideally, communication between modules should happen through well-defined interfaces to maintain this separation and prevent tight coupling.

## **A Practical Example: E-commerce Pricing**  

Let‚Äôs take a real-world example‚Äîan **e-commerce platform**. In such a system, we typically deal with sub-domains like Customers, Orders, Pricing, Fulfilments, and more. A clean way to organise the application code is to split it along these sub-domains, creating vertical slices.

Each slice, like 'Customers' or 'Orders', owns its corresponding part of the database‚Äîthink of it as each module having its own private section within the broader database. For instance, the Customer Module interacts only with Customer Tables, the Order Module with Order Tables, and so on. This separation keeps boundaries clear and reduces the chances of unintended ripple effects. So, if you ever need to change how customer data is stored, you can do so without impacting the way orders or pricing work.

This approach **reduces coupling**, **improves scalability**, and **maintains transactional integrity** without unnecessary dependencies.

## **Managing Communication Complexity Between Modules**  

When **evolving a monolith into a modular monolith**, the key is **decoupling communication**:  
- **Avoid direct module-to-module dependencies**‚Äîinstead, use **public interfaces**  
- **Leverage event-driven communication** between modules  
- **Ensure events are only generated after the action occurs (past tense. e.g., saved instead of save)**  
- **Try to avoid command-based events since this will complicate the event based architecture**  

This event-driven pattern also provides a **natural migration path**‚Äîif needed, we can **evolve** a modular monolith into microservices over time.

## **Final Thoughts: Keep Payloads Small**  

One of my biggest takeaways from **Udi Dahan** (a leading expert in **Service-Oriented Architecture & Domain-Driven Design**) is:  

> **Keep event payloads small.**  

Regardless of whether we‚Äôre working with **modular monoliths or microservices**, inter-service communication should favour **passing only the unique identifiers** (e.g., an **Order ID**) rather than entire objects. Use fat payload only in exceptional cases where the services face scalability issues.

**Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send - Postel‚Äôs Law**

### **In summary:**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Monoliths and microservices each have trade-offs**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Modular monoliths offer a balanced middle ground**  
‚úîÔ∏è **If designed correctly, they solve many distributed system challenges while still allowing future scalability**  

Would I fully embrace modular monoliths? **It depends on my usecase. I would favour this approach over big-bang Monolith decomposition.**  
But as with any architecture, the key is **understanding the trade-offs** before committing. üöÄ
