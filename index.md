# Code-doodles!
Welcome! Here you'll find my practical experiments and thoughts on interesting Java features and architectural patterns. After two decades benefiting from the generosity of the Java developer community, I'm excited to contribute my own experiences. As a mother of two young children, time is precious, but I'm committed to sharing solutions to tricky issues and showcasing valuable, lesser-known libraries. I hope you find something useful here!
