# Welcome to Code-doodles!
Here you will find some of my experiements using Java, Spring Boot, some 3rd party libraries etc. I have decided to open this page with the intention of returning  the favours the Java developer communities have showered on me in my 20+ years of IT career. Being a mother of two small children, finding time for this extra curricular activity is an issue. Yet, I will be at your service sharing some of my experiences with you guys in the limited time available. I will cover some topics, that I found hard to solve or those useful libraries which I really liked but had limited documentation. Hope you guys will enjoy my doodles!
